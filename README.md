****DeepSeek Repository****

**1. SimpleRagwithDeepSeek**

This project demonstrates a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using the ollama (deepseek-r) model. It highlights the model's Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning capability, showcasing its ability to break down complex queries step-by-step to provide more accurate and insightful responses.

Key Features:

RAG Application: Efficient retrieval and answer generation based on input queries.

CoT Reasoning: Demonstrates the model's structured thinking capability.

How to Get Started:

_Clone this repository:_

git clone https://github.com/D1EE7P2U9/DeepSeek-Repo.git

_Navigate to the SimpleRagwithDeepSeek directory:_

cd SimpleRagwithDeepSeek

Follow the instructions in the project README to set up and run the application.
